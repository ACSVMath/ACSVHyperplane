# ACSVHyperplane
This repository contains a Maple package for the analysis of functions whose denominators are products of linear real factors, 
developed as part of the paper *Asymptotics of multivariate sequences IV: generating functions with poles on a hyperplane arrangement* by
Yuliy Baryshnikov, Stephen Melczer, and Robin Pemantle. 

The package is contained in `Hyperplane.mpl` and **requires** the `Kronecker` Maple package from *Effective Coefficient Asymptotics of Multivariate Rational Functions via Semi-Numerical Algorithms for Polynomial Systems* by Stephen Melczer and Bruno Salvy. The Kronecker package is redistributed here in `Kronecker.mpl`.

Examples of using the package are given in the `Hyperplane-Examples.mw` worksheet. Users without access to Maple can view the examples from the paper in `Hyperplane-Examples.pdf`.
